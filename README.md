# SpiceOfLife
Spice Of Life adds spices to the Minecraft as a early game replacement for potions. 
Currently its very early in development and doesn't have a release date planed.

It is also the second mod I have made so the code will be iffy and I will have to rewrite it as I learn more. 
Please feel free to suggest ideas and improvments. 

##Things I need help with:
- Textures
- General code review and improvement

##Objects currently in the game
###Items:
- Cinnamon Bark
- Cinnamon Powder
- Cinnamon Apple
